                                The Commission has set an overall goal of improving the lives of more than 3 million
                                people by 2030. The Cancer Survivorship â€“ AI for Well-being cluster is helping for the
                                realization of this objective to be realized. The cluster brings together 11 EU-funded
                                projects working in Artificial Intelligence for healthcare and well-being. Primarily,
                                the Cluster focuses in the post-cancer treatment space with a collective aim to
                                cross-fertilise. This brings to transcend individual project experiences for the wider
                                good and outcome of their individual projects. The Cluster started in October 2020 and
                                it is evolving. Presently, it is flourishing with members collectively working on
                                related issues spanning topics around clinical, technical and business. The Cluster
                                fosters cooperation for the ultimate benefit of the patients, care-givers and of course,
                                medical professionals involved in the care team undertaking. The News article explains how

                                The workshop brings the alpha-platform to the target community over 3 streams so that the
                                co-creation engagement process continues to enable needed capability by frontline
                                responders to be better captured in a disaster risk management and CBRN-E situation,

                                How does the PEERS project engage with INCLUDING? Have a read of the article published
                                in the INCLUDING project. Interoperability is a vital part of the PEERS project and also
                                for INCLUDING. Both the INCLUDING and PEERS projects are inter-related by their mission
                                and quest to strengthen European resilience, although the scope of PEERS is wider as it
                                covers the full spectrum of CBRNe and not only the nuclear and radiological threat aspects.
                                Notwithstanding that, Article 6 of the European Commission Action Plan between Civil,
                                Space and Defense Industry, 2021 is extremely prevalent to both projects and in mutual
                                support the development of Better Practice Guides and APIs to strengthen interoperability,
                                will further help to contribute to the sharing of knowledge and resources as well as the
                                long-term sustainability intent directed by the Co-Creation Group in PEERS. Through the
                                integrated Virtual Reality component of the PEERS ecosystem, the learning capacity of
                                INCLUDING can be strengthened for the wider benefit of the community supported by
                                both projects. PEERS is committed to holding more Meetings of Minds (MoM) events and
                                sees a logical connection in obtaining further co-creation feedback so that the gamma
                                version of the PEERS platform delivers what the community needs and complements the
                                federated model of INCLUDING.
