         <p>
            FAITH is an EU-funded research project that aims to provide an Artificial Intelligence application
            that remotely identifies depression markers using Federated Machine Learning to support people who
            have undergone cancer as well as their care giver and consultant team. FAITH focuses primarily with
            patients who have undergone either lung and breast cancer and applies the latest Artificial Intelligence a
            nd Big Data analytics techniques to better model post-treatment cancer patients. Post-cancer patients are
            particularly vulnerable to depression insurgence. Depression is one of the most common comorbidities in
            cancer patients: overall, people with cancer are at an increased risk of mortality in comparison with
            non-depressed patients. In fact, too often the symptoms of depression go unnoticed, or clinicians can
            dismiss them as being symptoms of cancer. Until their depression is eventually diagnosed and treated,
            these people experience tremendous suffering. The project is led by the Walton Institute for Information
            and Communications Systems Science (formally, WIT-Telecommunication Software and Systems Group), Ireland.

            The project aims to build an ‘AI Angel’ that will remotely analyse depression markers. The markers are
            assessed in accordance with the traditional, tried and trusted 3M strategy – Monitor, Measure and Manage.
            As a result of the AI Angel application, FAITH will predict negative trends in patients’ disease trajectory,
            enabling better treatment and care to be realised. In order to analyse depression markers, FAITH will monitor
            data sources such as a patient’s activity, outlook, sleep, appetite and voice tone. The patients’ mobile phone
            will record all the data via an ‘Angel App’. The solution will be interfacing with the patient from home and
            will eventually send warnings to the hospital whenever suspicious red flags appear. In addition to this,
            FAITH will require only one extra device to monitor sleep. By using Federated Machine Learning, FAITH will
            deliver personalised AI models directly to each patient’s device, therefore, eliminating the requirement for
            data to be sent to the Cloud for processing. Using Federated Machine Learning enables privacy concerns relating
            to the potentially sensitive data to be overcome. Federated Machine Learning is a machine learning technique
            that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized devices holding data samples locally. Thus, Federated
            Machine Learning enables FAITH to analyse patients’ data whilst fully respecting their privacy, since the
            approach does not require the sensitive data to leave the person’s devices to be analysed. FAITH trials
            are in Waterford, Lisbon and Madrid.

            <strong>TFC Research and Innovation Limited</strong> (@TFCRIL) operates in FAITH to enhance the project
            findings by working closely with the Project Coordinator in both quality and risk management as well as
             working across each work package leader. The company also leads the <strong>project clustering</strong>
             activities and heads up the standardisation and <strong>best practice development</strong> activities.

            According to the World Health Organisation website (8th March 2021), cancer is the second leading cause
            of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths, in 2018. Lung,
            prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast,
            colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women. The cancer burden continues
            to grow globally, exerting tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families,
            communities and health systems.

            FAITH supports patients and healthcare providers in their post-cancer battle stage of life.
