         <p>
            FAITH is an EU-funded research project that aims to provide an Artificial Intelligence application
            that remotely identifies depression markers using Federated Machine Learning to support people who
            have undergone cancer as well as their care giver and consultant team. FAITH focuses primarily with
            patients who have undergone either lung and breast cancer and applies the latest Artificial Intelligence a
            nd Big Data analytics techniques to better model post-treatment cancer patients. Post-cancer patients are
            particularly vulnerable to depression insurgence. Depression is one of the most common comorbidities in
            cancer patients: overall, people with cancer are at an increased risk of mortality in comparison with
            non-depressed patients. In fact, too often the symptoms of depression go unnoticed, or clinicians can
            dismiss them as being symptoms of cancer. Until their depression is eventually diagnosed and treated,
            these people experience tremendous suffering. The project is led by the Walton Institute for Information
            and Communications Systems Science (formally, WIT-Telecommunication Software and Systems Group), Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project aims to build an ‘AI Angel’ that will remotely analyse depression markers. The markers are
            assessed in accordance with the traditional, tried and trusted 3M strategy – Monitor, Measure and Manage.
            As a result of the AI Angel application, FAITH will predict negative trends in patients’ disease trajectory,
            enabling better treatment and care to be realised. In order to analyse depression markers, FAITH will monitor
            data sources such as a patient’s activity, outlook, sleep, appetite and voice tone. The patients’ mobile phone
            will record all the data via an ‘Angel App’. The solution will be interfacing with the patient from home and
            will eventually send warnings to the hospital whenever suspicious red flags appear. In addition to this,
            FAITH will require only one extra device to monitor sleep. By using Federated Machine Learning, FAITH will
            deliver personalised AI models directly to each patient’s device, therefore, eliminating the requirement for
            data to be sent to the Cloud for processing. Using Federated Machine Learning enables privacy concerns relating
            to the potentially sensitive data to be overcome. Federated Machine Learning is a machine learning technique
            that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized devices holding data samples locally. Thus, Federated
            Machine Learning enables FAITH to analyse patients’ data whilst fully respecting their privacy, since the
            approach does not require the sensitive data to leave the person’s devices to be analysed. FAITH trials
            are in Waterford, Lisbon and Madrid.

            <strong>TFC Research and Innovation Limited</strong> (@TFCRIL) operates in FAITH to enhance the project
            findings by working closely with the Project Coordinator in both quality and risk management as well as
             working across each work package leader. The company also leads the <strong>project clustering</strong>
             activities and heads up the standardisation and <strong>best practice development</strong> activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the World Health Organisation website (8th March 2021), cancer is the second leading cause
            of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths, in 2018. Lung,
            prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast,
            colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women. The cancer burden continues
            to grow globally, exerting tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families,
            communities and health systems.

            Launched on November 1st, 2022, PEERS (<a href="https://peers-project.eu" target="_blank">www.peers-project.eu</a>) aims to advance and
            reinforce the European Union’s operational safety and security policies through the
            development of a practitioner-driven ecosystem focused on pre-normative / standardisation
            processes and supporting tools. The PEERS ecosystem supports the effective strengthening
            of preparedness and response in the field of CBRN-E through the practitioner-driven Better
            Practice Guide initiative, gamification and e-Learning support. It primarily targets assisting
            Europe's disaster risk management for natural hazards and CBRN-E practitioners, European
            research policymaking as well as other stakeholders including the research community and
            national standardisation bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the ecosystem includes an integration capability to existing community-building
            platforms and a gamification strategy, aimed at encouraging solid user engagement,
            strengthening interactions activities, and furthering user training skills based on situational
            awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            PEERS brings together an experienced, multi-disciplinary team of specialists, to work
            together as a focused delivery team on meeting policymaker and practitioner expectations
            over the course of the project and deliver transformational change in the CBRN-E
            environment.

            PEERS is funded by the European Commission’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme,
            PracticE Ecosystem for standaRdS (PEERS) is a 36-month project that addresses the needs of
            the Horizon-CL3-2021-DRS-01-04 call. <strong>TFC</strong> works across each work package, leading Co-
            Creation and as deputy project leader helps each work package leader and the consortium
            as a whole through the process of risk management engagement. TFC, creator of the Better
            Practice Guide initiative, also moves the undertaken in line with desire for a rejuvenation of
            interest of practitioners into both Better Practices and Standardisation.
        </p>

            Launched on October 1st, 2023, the Horizon Europe project, B-PREPARED, aims to deliver a
            cost-effective solution for building a culture of disaster preparedness with a multi-actor
            approach in realistic historical scenarios. B-PREPARED will build on a freely accessible
            massive collaborative knowledge base and data hub to demonstrate its usefulness via three
            demonstrator applications:  a cooperative multiplayer Virtual Reality serious game,
            simulating real disaster scenarios for the safest near-real experience; an interactive gamified
            mobile app with age-appropriate content and enhanced accessibility to people with specific
            functional needs for the widest possible reach; as well as an Learning Management System
            to effectively and comparably measure preparedness levels achieved by Virtual Reality
            and/or mobile users on a unified scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of the B-PREPARED solution enables players can apply different roles to
            solve puzzle tasks in an immersive experience. Teamplay, collaboration and communication
            are keys to survival, strengthening the culture of mutual assistance and cooperation in
            danger.  Player behaviour and gameplay logged in a privacy-preserving way helps collect data
            on in-game behaviour which serves assessment of preparedness but will also be shared with
            other synergic research in the same field.
        </p>
        <p>
            A large-scale virtual reality hackathon series will demonstrate B-PREPARED outcome
            features. Notably, it is the intention of the Consortium to make the open beta publicly
            available as a giveaway and to invite stakeholders via direct outreach.  Thus, after closing
            beta, the game will be available in a non-profit freemium model where in-game purchases
            are replaced by in-game donations for relief organizations, with a small percentage kept for
            maintenance and further development.
        </p>
        <p>
           B-PREPARED brings together an experienced, multi-disciplinary team of specialists, to work
            together for the delivery of the cost-effective solution. <strong>TFC</strong> will work across most work
            packages building on from the success of the Better Practice Guide initiative, clustering and
            project management capability and leading with the policy maker and educational institute
            engagement activities.
