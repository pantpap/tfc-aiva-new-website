                <strong>SPEEDIER</strong> is a European project funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme, Grant number
                847034. The central output is an innovative SPEEDIER Service provision would be of particular interest
                to <strong>Small to Medium sized Enterprises</strong> (SMEs) and <strong>Energy Efficiency Experts.</strong>
                The project is led by Tyndall - International Energy Research Centre (IERC), Ireland. <strong>TFC Research and
                Innovation limited</strong> brings much <strong>lateral thinking</strong> to the project and works
                across each work package across many related projects, leading in <strong>risk management</strong>
                and <strong>better practice guide development</strong>.

                SPEEDIER is aimed at addressing the knowledge and resourcing barriers that prevent SMEs from undertaking
                an energy audit and implementing the recommended energy-saving measures. SPEEDIER is a highly innovative
                <strong>one-stop-shop solution</strong> that outsources the time consuming and technical energy
                management tasks to a  SPEEDIER Expert who guides the SME through the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                SPEEDIER delivers an integrated approach to energy management for SMEs, providing information, advice,
                capacity building, energy assessment, financing as well as the implementation of energy efficiency
                solutions and for monitoring of implementation impacts. SPEEDIER, delivers the Service that is
                self-financing for outsourced energy management with several benefits for the SMEs.

                The SPEEDIER Service enables energy, cost and carbon savings associated with the implementation
                of Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) to be more readily realised. The composition of the SPEEDIER
                Service includes the development of a smart device app and a software audit tool for use by the Energy
                Experts during an energy assessment process at an SME client. The software tool provides a clear
                framework to assist Energy Experts to gather the data required to conduct a robust energy assessment
                and to enable them to present to their SME client a range of possible ECMs, classified into no-cost,
                 low-cost, medium-cost and high-cost categories. The information gathered and entered into the
                 SPEEDIER audit software tool supports the Energy Expert to identify the package of ECMs that
                 are most appropriate for them, to calculate the likely energy and cost savings as well as to
                 measure the actual savings post-ECM implementation against the baseline. A ring-fencing of the
                 subsequent cost savings, delivered as part of the SPEEDIER Service, will enable the SME to invest
                 in further energy conservation measures. The App is also highly innovative to support energy
                 efficiency cultural changes in SMEs and involves gamification.
                 <strong>TFC Research and Innovation Limited</strong> (@TFCRIL) works across each work package and
                 <strong>bringing much fresh thinking</strong> to the project.<strong>TFC</strong> leads one of the

                STAIR4SECURITY is an EU-funded project. It is aimed at the creation of a collaborative platform as single-entry point of information on the operational security sector derived mainly from EU research activities allowing a better governance of standardisation needs. The undertaking is specific for the needs of Disaster Risk Resilience (DRR) and Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNe) community. The project primarily delivers a platform and a supporting eLearning tool suited for the targeted stakeholder community. The platform is kernel of the project. It contains a repository of information and outcomes from standardisation, better practices, research and innovation from operational security related projects. It builds on from a legacy of identified projects and enables stakeholders to populate the content of the platform. Policy making driven, the platform is a heavily practitioner and business-orientated focused and can enable better-informed decision-making to be more easily realized by the stakeholders. The composition of the platform will evolve through stakeholder engagement but will provide a better overview of current and new projects being at, national, European or International level. This helps to ensure better coordination between all key stakeholders, such as first responders and CBRN experts, and to provide a basis for improved responds to critical needs. The project is led by European Standardization Organisation (CEN / CENELEC), Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Community acceptance is to the forefront of the STAIR4SECURITY project. The target community faces many challenges to improve European resilience to new attacks and threats. It spans issues from increased globalisation and security threats that are growing in scale and sophistication through to a series of issues such as increased risks of incidents caused by malicious action. Conditions and the threat sophistication are constantly evolving and a multi-stakeholder crisis response is always necessary. The need to transfer research and innovation results into a standardised mechanism is of paramount importance. However, the community must trust the STAIR4SECURITY platform for it to be effective and to willingly populate the content of the platform. This is one of the main challenges faced in the project. The platform enables policymaker’s and people enforcing DRR and CBRNe preparedness and response to address their potential needs in standardisation, better practices, research and innovation to support their work and future coordination efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The STAIR4SECURITY platform enables users to network and importantly to contribute to the platform resources and services. The e-Learning tool is designed to support users to maximise their usage of the platform and to strengthen their knowledge on DRR/CBRN standardisation and better practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                TFC Research and Innovation Limited operates in STAIR4SECURITY to provide much lateral thinking and guidance on the work being undertaken on the development of the platform and eLearning tool. The company also leads the dissemination and communication work package and is heavily engaged across multiple related EU-projects and the European Commission in the project.

                <strong>NO-FEAR</strong> is an EU-funded project that brings together a <strong>pan-European community</strong>
                 primarily comprising of Emergency Medical Care practitioners, suppliers, decision and policy makers
                 collaborating to exchange knowledge, understanding best practices and lessons learnt. Members of the
                 network, collectively, work as an entity to develop a common understanding on innovation potentiality,
                 which includes standardisation in order to fulfil operational gaps and to pinpoint areas for future
                 research. The undertaking involves a multi-disciplinary, multi-national and multi-sectorial collaboration
                 and is supported by a virtual tool including the NO-FEAR platform and a series of network events,
                 which includes workshops, demonstrations and exercises on a regular interval. The project is led by
                 CRIMEDIM – Research Centre in Emergency and Disaster Medicine, University Del Piemonte Orientale (UPO), Italy.

                <strong>Emergency medical systems and critical care: what are the challenges?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Safety and security incidents, such as terroristic attacks, armed conflicts, and infectious diseases m
                ay have an international, if not a global impact. Therefore, the response and management of these
                scenarios involves the coordination of a number emergency services, medical practitioners as well
                as first responders. Response needs can be cross-border and simultaneous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Differences in organisational set ups, tools, decision-making processes, infrastructure and approach
                can result in poor emergency medical care. For example, the fragmentation of actors responding to
                security related incidents, lack of communication between practitioners and suppliers and lack of
                suitable standards can lead to extended response times.
