                        We instigate stakeholder engagement through the development of Cluster Groups who have a
                        specific interest on a topic and bring different intelligence to the table so that perceived
                        understanding and perspectives can be ascertained with follow up support and actions

                        "We don’t work in silo" is the motto we apply to our collective work with participants

                        researchers and technologists, working collectively with smart technology with the aim to b
                        etter support patients and their care team in an ever changing world.

                        White Paper (May’ 23) from this Cluster is available online. It describes the incredible work
                        of the Cluster since its formation in October 2020 and includes recommendations for
                        improvements into research areas.
