                        <strong>Horizon Europe</strong> is the EU's key funding program for Research & Innovation
                        with a budget of â‚¬95.5 billion. It will run from 2021 to 2027. TFC is involved in a number
                        of Horizon Europe projects and developed a number of successful proposals. Each single
                        stage proposal has 3 fundamental sections: Excellence, Impact and Implementation and they
                        have unique requirements. Well acquainted in the delivery of proposals on behalf of client
                        organizations, we engage with a large European network and on a fee-based arrangement to
                        support delivery to the European Commission. We are specialized in advice, support and
                        project management for Horizon Europe projects.
