                    TFC has a skill set that embodies creative thinking.
                    The company utilizes itsâ€™ conceptualism approach for much of our work, characterized by the
                    introduction of lateral thinking and fresh ideas to expand an initial or drafted concept,
                    which may/may not be instigated inhouse, by a partner or client. Often, we instigate practical
                    fresh-ideas to strengthen innovation outcomes. We apply this approach through the many facets of
                    scientific research and business, often evident at proposal development stages for
                    European & National projects as well as at design and development stages.
