                        PEERS primarily targets Europe's CBRN-E practitioners, European research policymaking as well
                        as other stakeholders including the research community and national standardisation bodies.

                        We welcome stakeholder engagement so that we work in a manner that best suits our primary targets,
                        giving the approved registered members of the Co-creation Group access to the PEERS platform
                        within the surrounding ecosystem.  We operate in a manner that is orientated towards European
                        front line practitioners and policy makers and apply a bottom up approach with a view to
                        strengthen European preparedness and response to a CBRN-E incident.
