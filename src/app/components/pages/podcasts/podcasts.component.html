                            We all know a person who has battled cancer. Mental health and depression after treatment
                            can be difficult and their quality of life significantly reduced. So what can technology
                            do about it? Listen to Christine O'Meara and Philip O'Brien from the Walton Institute,
                            Ireland, on what they have to say in answering this question as they speak opening about
                            Artificial Intelligence and Federate Learning and how it can contribute to improving the
                            life of the post cancer treatment patient.
